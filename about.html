        <p style="font-size:20px">Kaitlen and I met in 2014 as Freshman in college. We started dating that same year
        and continued to date all the way through college. I proposed to her at the end of our senior year (see picture below 
         and we got married on March 23rd, 2019. We have 3 dogs and 2 sons, and we live in a house that we designed and had built
         in Grantsville, UT.</p>
         <p style="font-size:20px">About 1 year ago now, Kaitlen and I found out we were pregnant. We were already shocked at the 
        pregnancy, so you can imagine how surprised we were when we found out it was twins! Elias and Nile are fraternal twins,
        and they were born on February 14th, 2022. They are healthy and growing like crazy!</p>
