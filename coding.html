        <h1>Becoming a Developer</h1>
        <p style="font-size:20px">There are several reasons why I am learning to code. First of all, this is a career I have always
         had interest in. I love problem-solving, and I feel like coding is a skill that I am wired for. I have spent my schooling years
         and my professional years thus far pursuing careers that have been fulfilling yet financially challenging. Now that I have two
         sons to provide for in addition to my wife, I have decided to flip towards a new chapter. Becoming a developer now checks all of
        my boxes. It allows me to do something that I know I will love, while also providing for my family and enabling me to do other things
         that I love as well. I am very excited about the future!</p>
